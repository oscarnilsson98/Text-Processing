### Text Processing ###
* The task is to build a web application that processes files containing text.
* The user should upload a file from his or her browser to the server and then be presented with the processed text.
* In the processed text the application should surround every occurrence of the most used word with foo and bar.
    * Example: if the most used word is 'the', the processed text should display 'foothebar' instead of 'the'.
* In this repository there are some useful textfiles for testing the application.
* Develop a web application with a restful web API and frontend
