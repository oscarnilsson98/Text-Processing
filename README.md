### Text Processing ###
* The goal of this project is to develop a web application with a restful web API and frontend
* The web application processes files containing text.
* The user should upload a file from his or her browser to the server and then be presented with the processed text.
* In the processed text the application should surround every occurrence of the most used word with foo and bar.
    * Example: if the most used word is 'microsoft', then the processed text should display 'foomicrosoftbar' instead of 'microsoft'.
* In this repository there are some useful textfiles for testing the application.
* Used technologies:
    * ASP.NET Core with Angular
